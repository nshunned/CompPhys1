plotMC.C: Access data stored in ROOT tree format
- each tree containd 5 variables accociated with a single measured "event"
- one tree represents the signal process, one the background

scanner.C: example of scanning selection requirements on variable to maximize expected S/B

VarAnalyzer.C: a more detailed scanning example, including a calculation of the correlation
coefficients between variables

selection.C: Generation of event variable distributions with selection cuts applied the data

select2d.C:  Generation of event variable distributions with (2D) selection cuts applied the data
