expFit.cpp : fit using a double gaussina model
expFit2.cpp : fit using the Gumbel distribution
              This is not a good model, it shifts the peak in the
	      model given by Wikipedia, then adds a normalization factor
	      4 parameters in total, but one parameter is redundant
expFit2b.cpp : Here an improved version of the Gumbel is used.
               Only 3 parameters are needed for the function
	       This version also uses a MINUIT method to plot a chi2 contour

The fits use the datafile distros.root.
Curiously the p-value comes out very high here for the Gumbel fit.
Remember, the average expected p-values for a fit matching the data can
be calculated, but the actual value in any single fit can end up over
a wide range!
distros_1.root contains alternate data (same distribution, just another
random sampling).
